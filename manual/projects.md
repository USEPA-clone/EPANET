# Working with Projects
Project files contain all of the information used to model a network. They are plain text files containing tables describing the different categories of network data and are usually named with a .INP extension. 

## Creating a New Project
To create a new project:
1. Click the ***File*** tab of the Menu Panel and then select ***New***.
2. You will be prompted to save any currently opened project if changes were made to it.
3. A new, unnamed project is created with all options set to their default values.

## Opening an Existing Project
To open an existing project:
1. Click the ***File*** tab of the Menu Panel and then select ***Open***.
2. You will be prompted to save any currently opened project if changes were made to it.
3. Use the standard Open File dialog form that appears to select a project file to open.

You can also drag and drop a file from the operating system's File Explorer or File Manager onto any area of the EPANET workspace.

## Saving a Project
To save a project under its current name select ***Save*** from the ***File*** tab of the Menu Panel.

To save a project using a different name:
1. Select ***Save As*** from the ***File*** tab of the Menu Panel.
2. Select a folder and file name from the standard Save File dialog that appears.

## Setting Project Defaults
Each project has a set of default values that are used unless overridden by the user. These values fall into three categories:
- Default ID labels (labels used to identify nodes and links when they are first created)
- Default node/link properties (e.g., node elevation, pipe length, diameter, and roughness)
- Default hydraulic analysis options (e.g., system of units, head loss formula, etc.)
To set default values for a project:
1. Click the ***Setup*** button  on the ***Project*** tab of the Menu Panel.
2. A ***[Project Setup]*** form will appear with pages for each category listed above.
3. Check the box in the lower right to save your choices for all new future projects.
4. Click ***OK*** to accept your choice of defaults.
The ***[Project Setup]*** form will also appear whenever a new project is created.

## Viewing a Project Summary

## Viewing All Project Data
